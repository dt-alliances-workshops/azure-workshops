# Lab 4: Dashboards & Notebooks

## 4.4 Use DQL in Notebooks to Analyze Data

In this section, you'll use pre-built notebooks to learn how to analyze logs, metrics, and business events using DQL. These notebooks have been automatically provisioned in your Dynatrace environment.

### Tasks to complete this step

1. In Dynatrace, open the **Notebooks** app from the left menu

2. You should see the following lab notebooks already available in your environment:
    - **Logs-Lab** — Learn DQL queries for analyzing log data
    - **Metrics-Lab** — Learn DQL queries for analyzing host and application metrics
    - **BizEvents-Lab** — Learn DQL queries for analyzing business events

3. Open each notebook and follow the instructions within to work through the exercises

!!! info "Answer Notebooks Available"
    If you need help with the DQL statements or want to see the expected results, there are corresponding answer notebooks available with similar names (e.g., **Logs-Answers**, **Metrics-Answers**, **BizEvents-Answers**). These show the completed DQL queries for each exercise.

!!! success "Checkpoint"
    Before proceeding to the next section, verify:

    - You opened at least one of the lab notebooks
    - You successfully ran the DQL queries in the notebook exercises
    - You understand how to use DQL to analyze logs, metrics, and business events
