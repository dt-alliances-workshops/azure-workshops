# Lab 4: Dashboards & Notebooks

## 4.5 Summary

Dashboards and Notebooks are essential tools for visualizing, analyzing, and sharing observability data. Both are powered by Grail, Dynatrace's unified data lakehouse, and use DQL (Dynatrace Query Language) to query logs, metrics, events, and entity data.

### What You Accomplished

In this lab, you completed the following:

| Section | Accomplishment |
|---------|----------------|
| **4.2 Dashboards** | Explored the prebuilt Azure Overview dashboard and created your own dashboard with DQL queries to visualize Azure log data |
| **4.3 Notebooks** | Built an interactive notebook with queries, filters, and visualizations; learned to refine results and change chart types |
| **4.4 Analyze Data** | Imported pre-built notebooks to analyze logs and metrics from the sample application using DQL |

### Key Takeaways

- **Dashboards for Monitoring** — Dashboards provide at-a-glance visibility into system health with real-time metrics, enabling teams to monitor KPIs and detect issues quickly
- **Notebooks for Analysis** — Notebooks enable deep-dive analysis and collaboration, combining DQL queries, visualizations, and markdown documentation in a single shareable document
- **Unified Query Language** — DQL provides a consistent syntax for querying all data types (logs, metrics, events, entities), eliminating the need to learn multiple query languages
- **Prebuilt Content** — Dynatrace provides prebuilt dashboards (like Azure Overview) and notebooks that you can use immediately or customize to your needs

### What's Next?

In **Lab 5**, you will explore Dynatrace AI Observability to monitor LLM-powered applications, analyze token consumption, troubleshoot latency issues, and view distributed traces with prompts and responses.
