# Lab 4: Dashboards & Notebooks

## 4.1 Intro

Dashboards and Notebooks are powerful tools in Dynatrace for visualizing, analyzing, and sharing observability data. Both are powered by Grail, Dynatrace's unified data lakehouse, and use the Dynatrace Query Language (DQL) to query logs, metrics, events, and more.

**Why Dashboards and Notebooks matter:**

- **Dashboards** provide at-a-glance visibility into system health, enabling teams to monitor KPIs and detect issues quickly
- **Notebooks** enable deep-dive analysis and collaboration, combining queries, visualizations, and documentation in a single document
- **DQL** provides a unified query language across all data types, eliminating the need to learn multiple query syntaxes

### Objectives of this Lab

🔷 Create a new Dashboard and add DQL queries to visualize Azure log data

🔷 Learn to change visualizations and customize dashboard tiles

🔷 Build a Notebook with queries, filters, and visualizations

🔷 Import pre-built notebooks to analyze logs and metrics from the sample application
