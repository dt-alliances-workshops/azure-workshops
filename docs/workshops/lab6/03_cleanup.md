# Lab 6: Cleanup & Reminder

## 6.3 Workshop Cleanup

When you are ready to cleanup the workshop resource, run this command to remove the Azure resources and Dynatrace configuration:

```
cd ~/azure-modernization-dt-orders-setup/provision-scripts
./cleanup-workshop.sh
```

The start of the script output will look like this:

```
===================================================================
About to Delete Workshop resources
===================================================================
Proceed? (y/n) : y

==========================================
Deleting workshop resources
Starting: Fri 07 May 2021 04:35:46 AM UTC

```

Eventually when it completes - plan for 5-10 minutes - it will look like this:

```
=============================================
Deleting workshop resources COMPLETE
End: Fri 07 May 2021 04:40:40 AM UTC
=============================================
```
