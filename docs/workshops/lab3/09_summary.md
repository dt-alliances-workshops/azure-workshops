# Lab 3: Azure Kubernetes Observability with Dynatrace

## 3.9 Summary

While migrating to the cloud, you want to evaluate if your migration goes according to the plan, whether the services are still performing well or even better than before, and whether your new architecture is as efficient as the blueprint suggested. Dynatrace helps you validate all these steps automatically, which helps speed up the migration and validation process.

In this section, you should have completed the following:

✅ Installed Dynatrace Operator on Azure Kubernetes cluster via Azure Portal

✅ Deployed the modernized sample application to AKS

✅ Reviewed real-time data for the sample application on Kubernetes

✅ Used the Kubernetes app to analyze cluster health and troubleshoot unhealthy nodes

✅ Identified underutilized workloads for resource optimization using DQL

✅ Troubleshot workload issues using Application Observability and Davis AI root cause analysis

✅ Detected and analyzed application security vulnerabilities in workloads

### What's Next?

In **Lab 4**, you will learn how to create Dashboards and Notebooks in Dynatrace to visualize, analyze, and share observability data using the Dynatrace Query Language (DQL).
