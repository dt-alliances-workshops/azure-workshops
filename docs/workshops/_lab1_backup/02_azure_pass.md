# Lab 1: Setting up Environment

## 1.2 Azure Pass Subscription Setup

To complete this workshop, you will be provided an Azure Pass Promo code.  A workshop staff will provide that code to prior or during the day of the workshop.

That Azure Pass Promo code enables you to have a separate Azure subscription setup under a separate account to provision all the resources needed to complete the workshop.

This free Azure subscription will be available to you for the next 5 days or until when the $100 credit is utilized by the Azure resources (whichever comes first).
