# Lab 2: Monitor Azure Cloud Resources

## 2.7 Summary

Congratulations! You have completed Lab 2 and learned how to monitor Azure cloud resources with Dynatrace.

In this section, you should have completed the following:

✅ Understood the Modern Cloud Operations framework (Prevent, Remediate, Optimize)

✅ Reviewed how Dynatrace integrates with Azure Monitor

✅ Explored the Clouds App for multi-cloud resource visibility

✅ Investigated resource configurations and Smartscape topology

✅ Analyzed logs directly from cloud resources in context

✅ Used DQL in Notebooks to query logs and metrics side-by-side

✅ (Optional) Explored governance queries for resource inventory, tag compliance, and cost optimization

✅ Compared Azure Monitor metrics with OneAgent metrics to understand when to use each

✅ Used Davis AI forecasting to predict resource utilization

### Key Concepts Covered

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Modern Cloud Operations** | Transform from reactive monitoring to proactive operations with Prevent, Remediate, and Optimize |
| **Clouds App** | Unified visibility across all cloud resources with logs, metrics, and configuration in context |
| **Infrastructure & Operations** | Deep visibility into hosts, processes, and services via OneAgent |
| **Smartscape** | Real-time topology graph showing relationships between resources |
| **Davis AI Forecasting** | Predict future resource utilization to prevent issues before they occur |

### What's Next?

In **Lab 3**, you will deploy a modernized microservices application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and learn how to use Dynatrace to monitor Kubernetes clusters, troubleshoot workload issues, and detect security vulnerabilities.
