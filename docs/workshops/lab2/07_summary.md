# Lab 2: Monitor Azure Cloud Resources

## 2.7 Summary

Modern Cloud Operations transforms reactive monitoring into proactive, automated operations. Dynatrace helps you prevent issues before they impact users, remediate problems with precise causal AI insights, and optimize your cloud environment by detecting underutilized resources.

### What You Accomplished

In this lab, you completed the following:

| Section | Accomplishment |
|---------|----------------|
| **2.2 Azure Monitor Flow** | Understood how Azure Native Dynatrace Service automatically ingests metrics and logs without additional infrastructure |
| **2.3 Clouds App** | Explored Azure resources in the Clouds App, reviewed metrics, configurations, and filtered by tags and regions |
| **2.4 Cloud Resource Analysis** | Used DQL in Notebooks to query logs, metrics, and run governance queries for inventory and cost optimization |
| **2.5 Compare Metrics** | Compared Azure Monitor metrics (Clouds App) with OneAgent metrics (Infrastructure & Operations) to understand when to use each |
| **2.6 Forecasting** | Used Davis AI forecasting to predict CPU utilization and prevent capacity issues before they occur |

### Key Takeaways

- **Azure Native Integration** — Dynatrace ingests Azure Monitor metrics and logs directly with zero infrastructure overhead, eliminating the need for Event Hubs, Functions, or manual data pipelines
- **Unified Cloud Visibility** — The Clouds App provides a single pane of glass for all cloud resources across Azure, AWS, and GCP with metrics, logs, configuration, and topology in context
- **Two Perspectives** — Azure Monitor metrics show platform-level health while OneAgent provides process-level visibility, distributed traces, and code-level diagnostics
- **Proactive Operations** — Davis AI forecasting predicts resource utilization trends, enabling you to address capacity issues before they impact users

### What's Next?

In **Lab 3**, you will deploy a modernized microservices application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and learn how to use Dynatrace to monitor Kubernetes clusters, troubleshoot workload issues, and detect security vulnerabilities.
