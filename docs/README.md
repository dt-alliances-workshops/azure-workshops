

## Workshop Overview

This hands-on workshop will demonstrate how Dynatrace’s AI-engine, Davis, performs automatic and intelligent root-cause analysis in hybrid cloud Azure environments. This will be followed by series of hands-on labs where you will:

1.  Setup a Dynatrace environment and sample applications within Azure
2.  Jump in and fully analyze an application within Dynatrace
3.  Start to see and understand application usage patterns, infrastructure consumption, service dependencies, benchmarking performance and how service levels can be tightly ensured.

### Workshop structure
The workshop breaks down into three sections. Plan on 2-4 hours for completion of the lab section.

* Prerequisites - Ensure your Dynatrace and Azure accounts are set-up
* Workshop Labs - Divided into modules, some labs include a step to run scripts that will provision Azure resources, deploy sample application, and configure Dynatrace.
* Cleanup Resources - Tear down workshop resources and keep on using the Free Trial! ​

By analyzing an application within Dynatrace, you’ll learn how to understand application usage patterns, infrastructure consumption, service dependencies, benchmarking performance and ensuring service levels, and enabling modern operations for cloud native architectures.

Attendees can expect to learn the following from this workshop:​

* Common challenges associated with modernization​
* How to solve challenges of hybrid cloud with Dynatrace observability​
* Improve acceleration of cloud workload adoption of Azure​
