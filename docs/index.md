# **Welcome to Azure Workshops**

This collection of Instructer-led labs and workshops is designed to guide you through common Azure services and development scenarios. Each module provides step-by-step instructions, code snippets, and verification checks.

We recommend starting with **Lab 1** to ensure your environment is set up correctly.

## **Tracking Your Progress**

As you work through the labs, the workshop automatically tracks your progress. Completed sections are marked with a **checkmark** (✓) and highlighted in **green** on the left navigation bar. This helps you easily see which sections you've finished and where to pick up next.

### Resetting Your Progress

If you need to redo a section or start over, you can reset your progress using the buttons at the bottom of each page:

- **Reset Section Progress** — Clears the completion status for the current section only, allowing you to redo that specific part of the lab
- **Reset All Progress** — Clears all completion status across all labs, resetting the entire workshop to the beginning

Look for these buttons at the bottom of any lab section page.
